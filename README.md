# nuke2fusion
A set of defaults for Fusion 9+ that makes transitioning from Nuke easier. 
Includes familiar Layouts from Nuke, a set of simlinked names for Nuke that creates Fusion equavalent nodes and hotkeys to mimic Nuke's default

A work in progress, the community can help expand if needed.

## Layouts
The Layouts are inspired by the default workspaces in Nuke8+. The following layouts have been made :
* Animation
* Compositing
* Floating
* Large Node Graph
* Large Viewer
* Scripting


## Macros (gizmos)
* Nuke names to Fusion nodes are provided, but upon creation they change to the Fusion equavalent for future reference.
* Includes a few small snippets of nodes to showcase similar functionality (Position2Points, Reconcile3d etc)

## Hotkeys
A set of default hotkeys for creating nodes, toggling view controls on/off, disabling nodes and more. With a small addition of using capital 
letters to indicate 3d nodes.

* Tab for node search with wildcard (moved from shift-space)
* Lower case letters for 2d nodes (m)erge, (w)rite, (r)ead, (b)lur etc..
* Upper case letters for 3d nodes (M)erge3d, (R)enderer3d, (T)ransform3d etc..
* (d) for disable/passthrough node
* (q) (while focused on the viewer) disables/enables on-screen controls
